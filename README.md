# switchdesk
This is a switch to windows streaming like SkyNX or In home switching . Based on SPACEDESK. NEED TO BE ON THE SAME WIFI OR LAN OR ETERNET AS THE COMPUTER HOST !

spacedesk for windows needed : 

- 32 bit https://spacedesk.net/downloadidd32

-64 bit https://spacedesk.net/downloadidd64

App v2 is currently working !(not for atmosphere 10.4 and later :( *) 
App is crashing !

* THE APP CAN BE ACCEDED BY THE SERVER SECTION , FILL IP = "YOUR LOCAL IP" and PORT = YOUR PORT(by default 8080)
TO FIND YOUR LOCAL IP , launch cmd and type "ipconfig" take the ip that is beggining by 192.168 ...
AFTER THAT THE PORT (the port doesn't matter , just let it to 8080 if you don't know what is it)
THEN LAUNCH server.py PYTHON 3 NEEDED (i think everyone has python on his computer , else : https://www.python.org/downloads/ (just download and follow instructions)
DO NOT FORGET TO LAUNCH YOUR SERVER
FINALLY , launch BROWSERNX on your switch : https://github.com/crc-32/BrowseNX/releases , or any other browser for switch , normally python script generated a link , for me : http://192.168.1.42:8080 , BUT IT'S COMPLETLY NORMAL IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME NUMBERS AFTER 192.168 !!! Whatever , you enter it and tadaaa you can acces to the spacedesk connection ! (note that all devices with a browser can acces it , just it optimised for the switch !)
